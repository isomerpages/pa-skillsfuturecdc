<p>SkillsFuture@CDC 2025 aims to help the community to be more aware of the
opportunities in the growth economies and take charge of their learning
to navigate the future employment landscape. The festivals shine a spotlight
on three highly sought-after industries of the future – Care, Digital and
Green.</p>
<p>SkillsFuture@CDC 2025 will take place from 16 July – 16 August 2025, with
the five CDCs organising learning festivals at different districts to promote
the importance of lifelong learning and skills upgrading to the residents.
These learning festivals will be filled with workshops, seminars and live
demonstrations to enable residents to have greater access to learning opportunities
and resources to stay relevant and lead an enriching life.</p>
