SkillsFuture@CDC 2023 aims to help the community to be more aware of the opportunities in the growth economies and take charge of their learning to navigate the future employment landscape and shines a spotlight on three highly sought-after industries of the future – Digital, Green and Care.

SkillsFuture@CDC 2023 will take place from 10 July – 5 August 2023, with the five CDCs organising learning festivals at different districts to promote the importance of lifelong learning and skills upgrading to the residents. These learning festivals will be filled with workshops, seminars and live demonstrations to enable residents to have greater access to learning opportunities and resources to stay relevant and lead an enriching life.
